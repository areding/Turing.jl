**Turing.jl** is a Julia library for general-purpose [probabilistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language). Turing allows the user to write models using standard Julia syntax, and provides a wide range of sampling-based inference methods for solving problems across probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and data science. Compared to other probabilistic programming languages, Turing has a special focus on modularity, and decouples the modelling language (i.e. the compiler) and inference methods. This modular design, together with the use of a high-level numerical language Julia, makes Turing particularly extensible: new model families and inference methods can be easily added.

Current features include:

- [General-purpose](https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/6-infinitemixturemodel/) probabilistic programming with an [intuitive modelling interface](https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/0-introduction/)
- Robust, efficient [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedHMC.jl) sampling for differentiable posterior distributions
- [Particle MCMC](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedPS.jl) sampling for complex posterior distributions involving discrete variables and stochastic control flows
- Compositional inference via Gibbs sampling that combines particle MCMC, HMC, [Random-Walk MH (RWMH)](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedMH.jl) and [Elliptical Slice Sampling](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/blob/master/src/inference/ess.jl)
- Advanced variational inference based on [ADVI](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedVI.jl) and [Normalising Flows](https://github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl)
